# Gbpjpy Scalper EA MT5

This code implements a specialized Forex trading robot developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. The EA operates as a full-time scalper, focusing on high-quality setups only. It is based on a neural network with multiple settings and optimized parameters to identify highly probable entry points. The EA places pending orders at specific times when the probability of the scalping strategy is at its peak.

## Code Explanation

### Global Variables
- `nextOrderTime`: Time for placing the next pending order.

### Expert Initialization Function
- `OnInit()`: This function is called during the initialization of the EA.
  - It sets up the necessary trading functions for the algorithm.
  - If the initialization fails, it prints an error message and returns `INIT_FAILED`.
  - It sets the initial `nextOrderTime` value to place the first pending order 1 minute from the current time.
  - Returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` if the initialization is successful.

### Expert Deinitialization Function
- `OnDeinit(const int reason)`: This function is called during the deinitialization of the EA.
  - It performs any necessary cleanup tasks.

### Expert Tick Function
- `OnTick()`: This function is called on every tick of the market.
  - It checks if it's time to place a pending order by comparing the current time with `nextOrderTime`.
  - If it's time, it determines the entry point using the neural network and optimized parameters.
  - It places the pending order at the specified entry point.
  - It updates `nextOrderTime` for the next pending order.

### Trading Functions
- `InitializeTradingFunctions()`: This function initializes the necessary trading functions.
  - TODO: Implement the initialization of necessary trading functions.
  - Returns `true` if the initialization is successful.

- `CleanupTradingFunctions()`: This function cleans up the trading functions.
  - TODO: Implement the cleanup of trading functions.

### Neural Network Logic
- `DetermineEntryPoint()`: This function determines the entry point using the neural network logic.
  - TODO: Implement the neural network logic to determine the entry point.
  - Returns the calculated entry point.

### Pending Order Placement
- `PlacePendingOrder(const double entryPoint)`: This function places a pending order at the specified entry point.
  - TODO: Implement the logic to place a pending order at the specified entry point.
  - Returns `true` if the pending order is successfully placed.
